Hello world. This file is created for the purpose of Git It exercises. I initially created the "hello-world" folder through terminal, with mkdir command. Then, I moved to the folder in terminal with cd command. After that, I made this hello-world folder a git repository with "git init" command. Finally, I created this file (readme.txt) in terminal with touch command. 

This line is added in order to see how "git diff" command works.
